# To add a generated source file to your library or binary, you need to do two
# things:
#   1.  Tell the make system to try to compile the generated file
#   2.  Provide a rule to make the generated file
#
# To do (1), just add the name of the generated file to the LIB_foo_SRC
# variable.  Prior to compiling any objects for LIB_foo, the make system looks
# in $(LIB_foo_SRC_DIR) for the files in the $(LIB_foo_SRC) list.  Any files it
# doesn't see there, it assumes must be generated, so it forces the creation of
# them in $(LIB_foo_OUT_DIR).
#
# For this creation to happen, you must have done (2), either by using an
# existing pattern rule (such as defined in makefiles/bison.mk or
# makefiles/re2c.mk), or by providing a custom rule in
# $(LIB_foo_SRC_DIR)/RULES.mk
#
# For more on custom rules, see add_a_custom_rule

# Example:
% ls ene/lib/mylib
foo.ypp
bar.cpp
bar.hpp

% cat > ene/lib/mylib/VARS.mk
LIB_mylib_SRC_DIR := $(SRC_DIR)

# Note that foo.tab.cpp will be generated using makefiles/bison.mk
LIB_mylib_SRC = foo.tab.cpp bar.cpp
