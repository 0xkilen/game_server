<h3>Solution:  monolithic make</h3>

<ul>
<li>A single make invocation knows all the rules and targets
<li>So you can ask it to build any set of items, and it'll do just that
<li>And make -jFOO always works
<li>And cross-directory dependencies always work
<li>And the overhead for an already-up-to-date build is low
</ul>
