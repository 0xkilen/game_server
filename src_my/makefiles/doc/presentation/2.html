<h3>Problems with previous makefiles</h3>

<ul>
<li>Hard to build just one item
<li>Didn't support Windows
<li>In ENE, automatic dependency tracking was broken
<li>In EDF, make -jFOO was broken
<li>A mostly up-to-date build still took a long time
<li>ENE and EDF had separate prebuilts
<li>EOSI and logging were prebuilts
</ul>
